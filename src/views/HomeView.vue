                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his overly nervous grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and intergalactic travel. Often finding themselves in a heap of trouble that more often than not created through their own actions, these two will get themselves out of trouble in the most entertaining way! This extremely clever show will blow your mind as well as all other parallel realities of your mind!</p>
                    <p>Rick Sanchez, a depressed, alcoholic, abusive, madman (who also happens to be a genius scientist with the ability to travel through dimensions) returns to his daughter Beth's life after two decades of being silent between the two. He finds her married to an incompetent, pathetic man named Jerry, and the couple has two teenage kids. Summer, the oldest girl, is a rebellious teen looking to have more friends at school, and Morty, the youngest child and a boy, is an anxious, quiet, and sweet kid. Rick makes Morty his sidekick and takes him on hilarious Interdimensional adventures, causing poor Morty to become steadily more miserable due to Rick's insane, abusive, and careless additude.</p>
                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>After going missing for nearly 20 years, Rick Sanchez suddenly arrives at his daughter Beth’s doorstep looking to move in with her and her family. Beth welcomes him with open arms, but her unremarkable husband Jerry isn’t too thrilled about the tearful reunion as Rick’s arrival serves to shake things up quite a bit around the household. Rick converts the garage into his personal laboratory and gets to work on all sorts of dangerous sci-fi gadgets and contraptions. That wouldn’t be so bad if not for the fact that Rick continues to involve his grandchildren Morty and Summer in his insane adventures. With the exception of the Pilot episode, each episode ends with a post-credits scene.</p>

            <h3>Theme Song</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The Theme Song is the song that plays over the title sequence that occurs at the beginning of almost every episode of Rick and Morty. The intro shows scenes from episodes of the show as well as some other scenes that were made only for the intro. The intro changes with different scenes each season except for the first and last scenes.</p>

                <h2>Main Cast</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Rick Sanchez</h3>
                    <p> A genius scientist and alcoholic whose inventions and experiments serve as the basis for the episodes. The grandfather of Morty Smith and Summer Smith, and the father of Beth. Rick was absent from the family for years, until he finally returned before the Pilot episode to live with the Smith family, much to the disapproval of Jerry. He currently resides in the garage of the Smith house where his entire laboratory is based. Here, he builds new inventions, travels to other dimensions, and tests things out on forms of alien life.</p>
                    <h3>Morty Smith</h3>
                    <p>Rick's impressionable and socially awkward teenage grandson who is often dragged along on his grandfather's escapades. Morty is a wimpy and nervous wreck who desperately tries to keep his sanity when taken on the bizarre and terrifyingly mind-bending adventures that Rick takes him on, which is already big enough of a problem as he already struggles to fit in at his own high school.</p>
                    <h3>Jerry Smith</h3>
                    <p>Morty's insecure father, whose disapproval of Rick's influence on Morty only deepens his marital troubles with Beth. Jerry constantly finds himself to be in a failing marriage with his wife as they always argue and never express the love for each other that most parents do.</p>
                    <h3>Summer Smith </h3>
                    <p>Morty's angst-ridden older sister who occasionally joins Rick on his adventures. She only cares about her friends and social life at school and is easily annoyed by her family, though she sometimes becomes jealous of Morty's relationship with Rick.</p>
                    <h3>Beth Smith</h3>
                    <p>Morty's holier-than-thou mother who is a cardiac surgeon for horses. Beth seems to have problems in her marriage with Jerry and usually considers leaving him for another guy.</p>
